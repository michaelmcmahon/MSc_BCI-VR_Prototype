# MSc_BCI-VR_Prototype
The purpose of thie repository is to distribute the code files for an open-source Brain Computer Interface Virtual Reality (BCI-VR) prototype to test the manipulation of 3D objects in a Virtual Reality Environments (VRE) aimed at improving motor rehabilitation outcomes.

The scope of this work is to build a low-cost, open-source, BCI VR prototype and to design a BCI scenario for Real-Time signal processing focused on deriving event-related desynchronization and synchronization changes (ERD/ERS) from the Precentral gyrus (Motor Cortex) allowing the manipulation of a simple 3D object within a basic Virtual Reality Environment. A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a closed-loop system composed of six steps: brain activity measurement, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, translation into a command and feedback. Neurofeedback is a very important component because, when information is visually returned back to the user about the success or failure of an intended act, evidence shows that this observation can modify sensorimotor activity and improve neural plasticity such as in the case of motor rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in cases of stroke, which is the commonest cause of acquired disability in Ireland. The significance of this research to the IT industry and Academia is to investigate if it is viable to create a low cost, effective, BCI VR solution, by way of an initial prototype, thereby opening up the potential for a more robust low-cost solution to be developed and made available to students and developers which is capable of analyzing a subjects BCI performance to a level acceptable for significant academic and industry experimentation opening up the field to much wider range of researchers.

This work was undertaken as part of my MSc in Software Engineering and Database Technologies for my minor thesis
